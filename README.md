The project has been **moved and continued under a new name and license**:

## Legacy Installation Notes (For Historical Reference Only)

If you are reviewing this repository for personal, private, or educational purposes:

- Clone the repo and use Node.js v21.x with npm.
- Run the bot using:
  `node main.js` or `node .`
  **Do NOT run `npm i`** - legacy `node_modules` are included because they contain heavily modified packages.
- Edit the code as needed and credit all contributors.
- Add your bot token in `.env` as:
  `token=bottoken`
- Fully configure `config.json`. Missing values may cause issues.
- Debug mode is enabled by default and reports non‑critical load errors.

**Important:**
Do not modify files listed in the license.
Run the bot in a separate folder away from personal files.
Incorrect placement may cause false positives in our API’s automated checks.

## Editing the Code (Legacy)
You may modify the code for private use.
We recommended Node.js 21+ and discord.js v14.
Pull requests were accepted with descriptions of changes, additions, or new modules.
